Reflection:Unique Constraints, ensure that each value in a specified column is unique across all rows.
 This prevents duplicate entries, which can lead to data inconsistencies and errors.
 For example, the book_id and book_author_id columns in your Books and Books_Authors tables,
 respectively, have unique constraints, ensuring that each book and author entry is distinct and identifiable.
